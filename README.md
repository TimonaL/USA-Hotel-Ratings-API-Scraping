# USA Hotel and Business Rating Data Analysis 

# Introduction

This project focuses on collecting, analyzing, and comparing hotel and business rating data across selected cities in the United States. The data was gathered using the Google Maps Places API and includes key metrics such as ratings, user reviews, and business types. The analysis aims to uncover trends in customer satisfaction and business performance, providing insights that can be leveraged for strategic decision-making in areas such as marketing and operations.

# Tools and Technologies Used

. Python: For data collection, manipulation, and analysis.

. Google Maps Places API: To gather real-time data on hotels and businesses in selected U.S. cities.

. Pandas: For data wrangling, cleaning, and structuring.

. Seaborn and Matplotlib: For data visualization and trend analysis.

# Data Collection

# Hotel Data Collection

The hotel data was collected from three major U.S. cities: Kent (Ohio), Boston (Massachusetts), and Seattle (Washington). Using the Google Maps Places API, data on 60 hotels was extracted, focusing on business status, ratings, user ratings, and location details.

# Business Data Collection

Similar to the hotel data, business data was collected across various U.S. cities using the Google Maps Places API. The dataset includes information on business types, ratings, user reviews, and geographical locations.

# Data Analysis

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Trend Analysis: Analyzed trends in hotel and business ratings across the selected cities to identify patterns in customer satisfaction.

Correlation Analysis: Explored the relationship between the number of user ratings and the average rating to determine customer engagement levels.

Geospatial Analysis: Examined the distribution of businesses and hotels across different regions to understand location-based trends.

Business Type Analysis: Investigated how different types of businesses and hotels perform in terms of customer ratings.

# Data Visualization

A variety of visualizations were used to illustrate the findings, including:

Bar Charts: To show the distribution of ratings across different business types and cities.

Scatter Plots: To analyze the correlation between user ratings and overall ratings.

Line Charts: Used for trend analysis over time.

# Key Findings
Customer Satisfaction: Both hotel and business ratings follow a similar distribution, with most ratings falling between 3 and 5 stars.

Correlation Between Ratings and Reviews: A positive correlation was observed between the number of user ratings and the average rating, indicating that businesses with more reviews tend to have slightly higher ratings.

Business Performance: Certain types of businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, tend to receive higher average ratings, with variations across different cities.
Conclusion

The analysis provides valuable insights into customer satisfaction and business performance across different U.S. cities. These findings can inform marketing strategies, operational decisions, and customer engagement initiatives. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of using APIs and data visualization tools to gain actionable insights from large datasets.

# Future Work

Predictive Modeling: Develop models to predict future business and hotel ratings based on historical data.

Sentiment Analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews and gain deeper insights into customer sentiment.

Advanced Geospatial Analysis: Further explore the impact of location on customer satisfaction by integrating more granular geospatial data.
