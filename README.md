USA Hotel Rating Data Analysis

Introduction

This project aims to collect and analyze hotel rating data for selected cities in the United States. The data is collected using the Google Maps Places API, focusing on hotels within a certain radius of specified locations. The collected data is then analyzed to gain insights into the hotel ratings across different cities.

Tools and Technologies Used

•	Python
•	Requests library for making API calls
•	Pandas for data manipulation and analysis

Collecting Hotel Rating Data

The data collection process involves making API requests to the Google Maps Places API to search for hotels in selected cities. The cities chosen for this analysis are Kent (Ohio), Boston (Massachusetts), and Seattle (Washington). For each city, a radius of 1000 meters is used for the search.

Analyzing Hotel Ratings

Once the data is collected, it is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis. The analysis includes exploring the distribution of hotel ratings, identifying any trends or patterns in the data, and comparing ratings across different cities. Additionally, the data may be visualized using various plots to provide a better understanding of the hotel rating landscape.
